1. Reading the BMP File Header
First, you need to read the BMP file header to find the starting point of the pixel data. BMP files typically have a 54-byte header.

2. Modifying Pixel Data
Modify the pixel data to embed the hidden message. Each pixel's color value (usually in RGB format) can be slightly altered to store bits of the message. Commonly, the least significant bit (LSB) of each color component is used for this purpose because changes to the LSB have minimal impact on the image's appearance.

3. Encoding the Message
Convert your text message into binary format. Then, embed each bit of the message into the LSB of the image's pixel data. You'll need to keep track of where you've embedded each bit to ensure you don't overwrite data.

4. Writing the Modified Image
After embedding the message, write the modified pixel data and the original header back to a new BMP file. This file will now contain your hidden message.

5. Decoding the Message
To retrieve the hidden message, read the BMP file, extract the LSBs from the pixel data, and reconstruct the binary message. Convert the binary data back to text to reveal the hidden message.

Example Workflow
Read the BMP file header to get the starting point of the pixel data.
Extract and modify pixel data to embed the message.
Save the modified image to a new file.
Decode the hidden message by reading the LSBs from the pixel data.
Considerations
Ensure the image is large enough to store your message.
Be aware that modifying the image may slightly alter its appearance.
This basic method can be improved with more sophisticated algorithms for better security and efficiency.
This approach provides a basic introduction to steganography in C. For practical use, you may want to consider additional error-checking and more advanced methods to improve the robustness and security of your implementation.
